# iris_knnmodel
this is a project for which the accuracy found is 98 percent. I used the data already present sklearn.datasets. 
iris is a flower which has different features. using these features we train the classifier and test the predicted results.
accuracy is found to be 98 percent and any out of sample data can be evaluated using the knn.predict,preds,pred_spesies shown in the codes
we also save the classifier model for future uses using joblib.
